                <h2>5. Who has access to your information?</h2>

                <p>Postiz does not rent or sell your information. We restrict access to your information to authorized employees and we do not share your information with third parties except in the circumstances explained below.</p>

                <h3>Authorized Contractors</h3>
                <p>Our authorized contractors may need to access information about you when they require this information to perform their job. For example, a customer support representative would need access to your account to validate your identity and respond to your question or request; our email communications team would need access to your contact information to ensure this information is sent correctly and any unsubscribe requests are properly managed; and our security staff would need to review information to investigate attempted denial of service attacks, fraudulent account activity, or other attempts to compromise the Services.</p>
                <p>All our employees and contractors are required to agree to maintain the confidentiality and protect the privacy of your information.</p>

                <h3>Service Providers, Authorized Resellers, and Partners</h3>
                <p>We will share limited information about you to authorized service providers we use for marketing services, communicating with you, managing our customer database, the provision of professional services, and providing and managing the Services (including hosting data centers, securing our Services, and payment processing).</p>
                <p>We limit the number of service providers who are permitted to process your Content for the purpose of assisting us in delivering the Services.</p>
                <p>Where you have purchased a service from an authorized reseller or partner, we may provide information about you to (and may receive information about you from) the reseller or partner as necessary to support your use of the service you purchased.</p>
                <p>When sharing your information with any of the above service providers, resellers and partners, we ensure they agree to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and only use your information to carry out the Services and your requests.</p>
                <p>We may also participate in and run marketing events (e.g. conferences, webinars, and provide resources) with sponsors and other organizations. Where the sponsors or other organizations wish to collect your information for their marketing purposes, while we may facilitate this (e.g. information may be collected on the same registration form), they will be doing so independently under their own policies. We will advise you and provide you an opportunity for you to share your information with the sponsors or other organizations for such purposes, either upon registration or during the event.</p>

                <h3>Social Networks and Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>Where you are using our Services and have chosen to connect your Social Networks to the Services, or if you authorize a Third-Party Service to access your account, you are agreeing to provide information about you to the Social Networks and the Third-Party Services under their respective terms and privacy policies. For example, if you choose to connect your YouTube account to the Services, this connection uses YouTube's API services, and the Google Privacy Policy (located <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy">here</a>) will apply to you.</p>

                <h3>Customer Organizations</h3>
                <p>Where your employer or an entity has purchased Services on your behalf, we may disclose information about you such as your name and email address, and some usage information including whether a user has logged in to the Service, frequency of login, time spent using the Services, and enrollment and completion of Postiz Academy courses to assist your employer or the entity in managing its use and maximizing the value of the Services.</p>

                <h3>Successor and Affiliated Entities</h3>
                <p>We may share information about you among Postiz-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries, and they will protect your information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and where applicable, in accordance with the privacy policy specific to the entity.</p>
                <p>We may also disclose your information as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets. If we do, we will inform such entities of the requirement to handle your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, or inform you that you are covered by a new privacy policy.</p>

                <h3>Law Enforcement, Government Agencies, and Professional Advisors</h3>
                <p>We may need to disclose information about you where we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law or regulation, or if we are otherwise legally required to do so, such as in response to a court order or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims or demands. For governmental data access requests concerning you or your organization, we would first attempt to redirect the request to you and/or we would first attempt to notify you unless we are legally prohibited from doing so.</p>
                <p>In addition, we may disclose information about you if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action: (a) against illegal activities, fraud, situations involving potential threats to our rights or property (or to the rights or property of those who use our Services), or to protect the personal safety of any person; or (b) regarding situations that involve the security of our Services, abuse of the Services infrastructure, or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, or denial of service attacks).</p>
                <p>We also use professional advisors, including lawyers and accountants, and may be required to disclose information about you when engaging them for their services and as necessary for audits, financial and other regulatory reviews.</p>

                <h2>6. What international data transfers occur at Postiz?</h2>

                <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection laws, information about you may only be transferred from your region to other regions if certain requirements are met. For instance, under the GDPR, information about you may be transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA) to outside the EEA if adequate data protections are in place.</p>
                <p>Our Services are managed by Postiz headquarters in USA. As the European Commission considers USA to be a country which provides adequate data protection, information about you may be transferred from the EEA to USA.</p>
                <p>Postiz also uses third-party service providers, such as managed hosting providers, credit card processors, and technology partners to provide the software, networking, infrastructure and other services required to operate the Services. These third-party providers may process or store personal data on servers outside of the the US. We rely on adequacy and standard contractual clauses (if sent to the US or onward to other countries) to ensure that information about you is lawfully transferred under EU law.</p>
                <p>By its nature, social media data can be shared with people around the globe. The Social Networks and Third-Party Services that you choose to integrate with our Services may collect, store, and process your information from various locations around the world according to their own terms and privacy policies.</p>

                <h2>7. How do we safeguard your information?</h2>

                <p>Postiz maintains industry standard security safeguards to protect your information. This includes ensuring our employees receive appropriate security and privacy training and guidance so they are aware of the measures they need to implement to protect your information.</p>
                <p>Access controls are in place to limit access to your information to those who need it to perform their jobs. For example, information about you may be provided to our customer support specialists to help you with your requests. Individuals who are permitted to handle your information must adhere to confidentiality obligations.</p>
                <p>We encrypt data in transit and at rest, where appropriate, to ensure that your information is kept private. We undertake service provider security and privacy reviews to ensure that service providers follow our stringent requirements to safeguard your information, and we also enter into data protection agreements with our service providers. All payment information is fully encrypted and handled only by PCI certified organizations.</p>

                <h2>8. How long do we retain your information?</h2>

                <p>In general for the Postiz Services, we do not permanently store Content from Social Networks. Rather, when you login to the Services, we retrieve data from Social Networks in real time so that it is displayed in the platform for viewing during your session. We store other Content that you produce (such as draft Content for publication on Social Networks) so that you can easily access this material on the Services.</p>
                <p>Aggregated data is used by Postiz for analysis, product improvement, and troubleshooting purposes. In some cases, Content may continue to exist on the Social Networks even after you or we delete it from our Services, and you will need to contact the relevant Social Network directly if you want it to remove this Content.</p>
                <p>We retain your information as long as required to provide the Services requested by you, for record keeping purposes, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce the terms for the Services. After it is no longer necessary for us to retain information about you, or otherwise upon your request, we will dispose of it in a secure manner or anonymize the information.</p>

                <h2>9. Postiz's roles under the GDPR and UK data protection laws</h2>

                <p>Depending on the situation and the type of data involved, Postiz may act as a data controller or a data processor.</p>

                <h3>Postiz as a data controller</h3>
                <p>Postiz may act as a data controller when we are:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>

                <h3>Legal bases for processing when Postiz is a data controller</h3>
                <p>The legal bases for processing information about you include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your consent (for example, when you have provided your information to sign up for an account or a webinar, or you have provided your employment history when applying for a job). Where we rely on your consent to process personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
                    <li>It is necessary to perform a contract (for example, we may need your information to fulfill our obligations to provide you with Services under the terms relevant to the Services you have acquired).</li>
                    <li>Legitimate interest (for example, to provide, maintain and improve the Services for you, to maintain the security of the Services, and to attract new customers to maintain demand for the Services.</li>
                    <li>In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data to comply with relevant laws (for example, processing payroll and tax information to comply with relevant employment and tax legislation); or processing is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, obtaining health-related information during a medical emergency).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Your rights when Postiz is a data controller</h3>
                <p>Where Postiz is acting as a data controller, we have outlined certain rights in the "What are your privacy rights?" section.</p>
                <p>In addition, you may have the following rights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Right to object to processing: You may request that Postiz stop processing information about you (for example, stop sending you marketing communications).</li>
                    <li>Right to restrict processing: You may request that we restrict the processing of information about you (for example, where you believe that this information is inaccurate).</li>
                    <li>Right to data portability: You may request that we provide you with information Postiz has about you in a structured, machine-readable, and commonly used format or transfer this information to another data controller.</li>

                <p>If you would like assistance on any of the above requests, please email our <a href="mailto:nevo@postiz.com">Privacy team</a>.</p>

                <h3>Postiz as a data processor</h3>
                <p>When you use our Services and make decisions about the personal data being processed in them (including selecting the Social Network accounts you wish to connect to the Services or uploading and using Content), you are acting as a data controller, and Postiz is acting as a data processor.</p>
                <p>As a data controller, you have certain obligations under the GDPR, including managing Content on the Services. As a data processor, Postiz will only access and process Content to provide you with the Services by your instructions (which you provide through the Services), the Terms of Service, the Social Networks' terms, and applicable laws. As part of delivering the Services, we may process Content to improve further the Services, such as enhancing usability and developing new features.</p>
                <p>As a data controller, suppose you require Postiz to agree to data protection requirements under Article 28, GDPR, or UK data protection laws. In that case, Postiz makes available a data processing addendum that meets these requirements.</p>
                <p>If you are using the Services as an authorized user of a Postiz customer (whether that customer is your employer, another organization, or an individual), that customer determines its own policies (if any) regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of personal data and Content, which may apply to your use of the Services. Please check with that customer about the policies and settings it has in place.</p>

                <h2>10. Your California Privacy Rights</h2>

                <h3>Your Rights</h3>
                <p>We have outlined certain rights in the section "What are your privacy rights?"</p>

                <p>While we disclose personal information to service providers for the purpose of managing our relationship with you (e.g. distributing marketing communications) and providing the Services, we do not sell your personal information.</p>

                <h2>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
